h1. WARNING VERY ALPHA

This is the first build of the gem. Use in production at your own imminent -devise- demise.

h1. APN on Mongoid (Apple Push Notifications on Mongoid)

APN on Mongoid is a rewritten fork of the APN on Rails gem. APN stands for Apple Push Notification [Service].
Its purpose is to allow the use of Mongoid and in turn a MongoDB for sending Push Notifications. Build for Rails 3 and Mongoid 2.X.

h2. Acknowledgements:

This gem is a re-write of the APN for Rails gem written by PRX and Mark Bates which is also a re-write
from a plugin that was written by Fabien Penso and Sam Soffes.
APN on Rails is a good gem but it has its limitations and restrictions on ORM use.

Most of the documentation listed below is a duplication of the documentation by APN on Rails. I respect
all the work that went into that gem.

h2. Converting Your Certificate:

Once you have the certificate from Apple for your application, export your key
and the apple certificate as p12 files. Here is a quick walkthrough on how to do this:

1. Click the disclosure arrow next to your certificate in Keychain Access and select the certificate and the key. 
2. Right click and choose `Export 2 items...`. 
3. Choose the p12 format from the drop down and name it `cert.p12`. 

Now covert the p12 file to a pem file:
<pre><code>
  $ openssl pkcs12 -in cert.p12 -out apple_push_notification_production.pem -nodes -clcerts
</code></pre>

Put 'apple_push_notification_production.pem' in config/

If you are using a development certificate, then change the name to apple_push_notification_development.pem instead.

h2. Installing:

h3. Bundler:
